<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> August 11, 2023</p>

This policy outlines the purpose of these technologies, why we use them, and how you can exercise control over their utilization.</p>

<h2>Understanding Cookies</h2>

<p>When you visit a website, small data files known as cookies are placed on your computer or mobile device. These cookies serve various purposes, from facilitating the functioning of websites to enhancing their efficiency, as well as providing valuable reporting insights.</p>

<p>Cookies set by the website owner, which in this case is bingster, are referred to as "first-party cookies." Those set by entities other than the website owner are termed "third-party cookies." The latter enable features or functionalities from third parties, such as advertising, interactive content, and analytics. These cookies can recognize your computer across the visited website and certain other websites.</p>

<h2>Reasons for Using Cookies</h2>

<p>We utilize both first-party and third-party cookies for specific reasons. Some cookies are essential for the technical operation of our Website, referred to as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Others allow us to track and target user interests, enhancing the overall experience on our Online Properties. Furthermore, third parties may employ cookies through our Website for advertising, analytics, and other designated purposes, as elaborated further below.</p>

<h2>Exercising Control over Cookies</h2>

<p>Each web browser offers varying means to reject cookies, making it advisable to refer to your browser's help menu for guidance. Here are insights into managing cookies on popular browsers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Internet Explorer</li>
  <li>Firefox</li>

<h2>Exploring Other Tracking Technologies</h2>

<p>Cookies aren't the sole method to recognize or track website visitors. We may also employ similar technologies occasionally, such as web beacons (also known as "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs").

This empowers us to monitor user traffic patterns, improve site performance, assess the success of email marketing campaigns, and more. These technologies often rely on cookies to function effectively. If you decline cookies, their functionality may be impaired.</p>

<h2>Flash Cookies or Local Shared Objects</h2>

<p>Websites might employ "Flash Cookies" (also known as Local Shared Objects or "LSOs") for purposes like gathering and storing information about service usage, fraud prevention, and other site operations. If you wish to avoid Flash Cookies, you can adjust your Flash player settings. However, restricting Flash Cookies might affect certain Flash applications' functionality.</p>

<p>Third parties may use cookies on your computer or mobile device to deliver advertising via our Website. These cookies gather information about your visits to our site and others to display relevant ads for products and services of potential interest to you. They might also measure the effectiveness of ads. This data doesn't enable identification unless you provide it.</p>
